      "text": "His law He enforces: the stars in their courses,\nThe sun in His orbit, obediently shine;\nThe hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains,\nThe deeps of the ocean proclaim Him divine,\n<br>We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing,\nWith glad adoration a song let us raise,\n<br>'Til all things now living unite in thanksgiving\nTo God in the highest, hosanna and praise."
