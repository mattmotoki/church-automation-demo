      "text": "God left the richest throne\nsalvation to bestow;\nbut Christ as flesh and bone\nthe world refused to know,\n<br>But, O my Friend, my Friend indeed,\nwho at my need did life expend;\nwho at my need did life expend."

      "text": "Sometimes they threw down palms\nand sweetest praises sang.\nHosannas and glad psalms\nthrough streets and markets rang.\n<br>Then \"Crucify!\" is all their breath,\nfor blood and death they thirst and cry;\nfor blood and death they thirst and cry."

      "page_name": "Verse 4",
      "text": "What has my Sovereign done?\nWhat makes this rage and spite?\nChrist gave new strength to run,\nrestored the gift of sight.\n<br>Sweet injuries! Yet they at these\nthemselves displease, and 'gainst Christ rise;\nthemselves displease, and 'gainst Christ rise."

      "text": "I sing my plain belief,\none song my heart out-pours:\nnever was pain nor grief,\nnever was love like yours.\n<br>This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise\nI all my days could gladly spend;\nI all my days could gladly spend."
