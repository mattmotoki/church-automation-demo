      "text": "He all my grief has taken, and all my sorrows borne;\nin temptation he's my strong and mighty tower;\nI have all for him forsaken, and all my idols torn\nfrom my heart, and now he keeps me by his power.\n<br>Though all the world forsake me, and Satan tempts me sore,\nThrough Jesus I shall safely reach the goal.\n<br>He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and Morning Star,\nhe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul."

      "text": "He will never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,\nwhile I live by faith and do his blessed will;\na wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,\nwith his manna he my hungry soul shall fill.\n<br>Then sweeping up to glory, to see his blessed face,\nwhere rivers of delight shall ever roll.\n<br>He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and Morning Star,\nhe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul."
