      "text": "Through our nation's spent frustration,\nthrough the corridors of stress\nmay there move a kindlier wisdom\nall may feel, and all may bless;\n<br>tax and tithe are for a purpose\nshared to shield the poor and weak;\npast the symptoms of our sickness\nlet the voice of justice speak."

      "text": "Honor those whose loving spirit\nnurses hope, restores and heals,\ntowel and basin used in service\nlike the Christ who comes and kneels;\n<br>in the tending, in the mending\nmay we see the right and fair,\nin our common quest for wholeness\nheal each other by our care."
