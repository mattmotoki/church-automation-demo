      "text": "We have come at Christ's own bidding\nto this high and holy place,\nwhere we wait with hope and longing\nfor some token of God's grace.\n<br>Here we pray for new assurance\nthat our faith is not in vain,\nsearching like those first disciples\nfor a sign both clear and plain."

      "page_name": "Verse 2",
      "text": "Light breaks through our clouds and shadows;\nsplendor bathes the flesh-joined Word;\nMoses and Elijah marvel\nas the heavenly voice is heard.\n<br>Eyes and hearts behold with wonder\nhow the law and prophets meet:\nChrist, with garments drenched in brightness,\nstands transfigured and complete."

    {
      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "Strengthened by this glimpse of glory,\nfearful lest our faith decline,\nwe like Peter find it tempting\nto remain and build a shrine.\n<br>But true worship gives us courage\nto proclaim what we profess,\nthat our daily lives may prove us\npeople of the God we bless."
