      "text": "Silence is a friend who claims us,\ncools the heat and slows the pace;\nGod it is who speaks and names us,\nknows our being, face to face,\n<br>making space within our thinking,\nlifting shades to show the sun,\nraising courage when we're shrinking,\nfinding scope for faith begun."

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "In the Spirit let us travel,\nopen to each other's pain,\nlet our loves and fears unravel,\ncelebrate the space we gain:\n<br>there's a place for deepest dreaming,\nthere's a time for heart to care,\nin the Spirit's lively scheming\nthere is always room to spare!"
