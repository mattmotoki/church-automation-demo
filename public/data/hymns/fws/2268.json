      "text": "Turn our worship into witness\nIn the sacrament of life;\nSend us forth to love and serve you,\nBringing peace where there is strife.\n<br>Give us, Christ, your great compassion\nTo forgive as you forgave;\nMay we still behold your image\nIn the world you died to save."

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "Gracious Spirit, help us summon\nOther guests to share that feast\nWhere triumphant Love will welcome\nThose who had been last and least.\n<br>There no more will envy blind us\nNor will pride our peace destroy,\nAs we join with saints and angels\nTo repeat the sounding joy."
