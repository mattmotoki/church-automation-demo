      "text": "We sang our glad Hosannas,\nand waved our branches high,\nbut some were silent, frowning,\nas Jesus rode on by.\n<br>They sought a royal Savior\nbut did not understand\na king could rule by loving,\ninstead of by command."

      "page_name": "Verse 2",
      "text": "We heard an angry Jesus\nin Temple courts declare,\n\"Be gone, you moneychangers!\nThis is a house of prayer.\"\n<br>Though many came for healing\nand stayed to hear his word,\nstill others, hostile, plotted\nand thus his death assured."

      "text": "We served him at the table\nwith wine, unleavened bread.\n\"The one who will betray me\nnow eats with me,\" he said.\n<br>His friends would not believe him,\nbut one by one that night,\nas soldiers came to take him,\nthey scurried out of sight."
