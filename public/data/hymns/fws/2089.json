      "text": "Wild and lone the prophet's voice\nechoes through the desert still,\ncalling us to make a choice,\nbidding us to do God's will:\n<br>\"Turn from sin and be baptized;\ncleanse your heart and mind and soul.\nQuitting all the sins you prized,\nyield your life to God's control."

      "page_name": "Verse 2",
      "text": "\"Bear the fruit repentance sows:\nlives of justice, truth, and love.\nTrust no other claim than those;\nset your heart on things above.\n<br>Soon the Lord will come in power,\nburning clean the threshing floor:\nthen will flames the chaff devour;\nwheat alone shall fill God's store.\""

      "text": "With such preaching, stark and bold,\nJohn proclaimed salvation near,\nand his timeless warnings hold\nwords of hope to all who hear.\n<br>So we dare to journey on,\nled by faith through ways untrod,\ntill we come at last like John\nto behold the Lamb of God."
