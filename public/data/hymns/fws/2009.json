      "text": "Then hear, O gracious Savior,\nAccept the love we bring,\nThat we who know your favor\nMay serve you as our King;\n<br>And whether our tomorrows\nBe filled with good or ill,\nWe'll triumph through our sorrows\nAnd rise to bless you still:\n<br>To marvel at your beauty\nAnd glory in your ways,\nAnd make a joyful duty\nOur sacrifice of praise."
