      "verse": 4,
      "text": "In the same way, my friends, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God."

      "verse": 7,
      "text": "What then should we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet, if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”"
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "text": "But sin, seizing an opportunity in the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law sin lies dead."

      "verse": 13,
      "text": "Did what is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure."
