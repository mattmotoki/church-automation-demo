    {
      "verse": 2,
      "text": "and to him Abraham apportioned “one-tenth of everything.” His name, in the first place, means “king of righteousness”; next he is also king of Salem, that is, “king of peace.”"

      "verse": 3,
      "text": "Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever."

    {
      "verse": 5,
      "text": "And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their kindred, though these also are descended from Abraham."

    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "text": "Now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthood—for the people received the law under this priesthood—what further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of Melchizedek, rather than one according to the order of Aaron?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "text": "For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well."

    },
    {
      "verse": 19,
      "text": "(for the law made nothing perfect); there is, on the other hand, the introduction of a better hope, through which we approach God."
    },
    {
      "verse": 20,
      "text": "This was confirmed with an oath; for others who became priests took their office without an oath,"
    },
    {
      "verse": 21,
      "text": "but this one became a priest with an oath, because of the one who said to him, “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‘You are a priest forever’ ”—"

    {
      "verse": 27,
      "text": "Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself."
    },
    {
      "verse": 28,
      "text": "For the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever."
