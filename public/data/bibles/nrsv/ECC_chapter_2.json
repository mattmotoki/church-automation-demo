      "verse": 3,
      "text": "I searched with my mind how to cheer my body with wine—my mind still guiding me with wisdom—and how to lay hold on folly, until I might see what was good for mortals to do under heaven during the few days of their life."

      "verse": 8,
      "text": "I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I got singers, both men and women, and delights of the flesh, and many concubines."

    {
      "verse": 11,
      "text": "Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had spent in doing it, and again, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun."
    },
    {
      "verse": 12,
      "text": "So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the one do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done."

    {
      "verse": 16,
      "text": "For there is no enduring remembrance of the wise or of fools, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How can the wise die just like fools?"
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "text": "So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind."

    },
    {
      "verse": 21,
      "text": "because sometimes one who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave all to be enjoyed by another who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil."
