      "verse": 1,
      "text": "Or do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law is binding on a person only during that person’s lifetime?"

      "verse": 2,
      "text": "Thus a married woman is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives, but if her husband dies, she is discharged from the law concerning the husband."

      "verse": 3,
      "text": "Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she belongs to another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she belongs to another man, she is not an adulteress."

    {
      "verse": 4,
      "text": "In the same way, my brothers and sisters, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God."

    {
      "verse": 5,
      "text": "For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death."

    {
      "verse": 7,
      "text": "What then are we to say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet, if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”"
    },
    {
      "verse": 8,
      "text": "But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law sin lies dead."

      "verse": 13,
      "text": "Did what is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin that was working death in me through what is good, in order that it might be shown to be sin, so that through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure."
