      "verse": 4,
      "text": "Hence, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that “no idol in the world really exists” and that “there is no God but one.”"

      "verse": 7,
      "text": "It is not everyone, however, who has this knowledge. Since some have become so accustomed to idols until now, they still think of the food they eat as food offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled."

      "verse": 10,
      "text": "For if others see you, who possess knowledge, eating in the temple of an idol, might they not, since their conscience is weak, be encouraged to the point of eating food sacrificed to idols?"
