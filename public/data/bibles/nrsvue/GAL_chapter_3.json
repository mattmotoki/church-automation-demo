      "verse": 2,
      "text": "The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard?"

    {
      "verse": 3,
      "text": "Are you so foolish? Having started with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh?"

      "verse": 8,
      "text": "And the scripture, foreseeing that God would reckon as righteous the gentiles by faith, declared the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “All the gentiles shall be blessed in you.”"

      "verse": 9,
      "text": "For this reason, those who believe are blessed with Abraham who believed."
    },
    {
      "verse": 10,
      "text": "For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law.”"
    },
    {
      "verse": 11,
      "text": "Now it is evident that no one is reckoned as righteous before God by the law, for “the one who is righteous will live by faith.”"

      "verse": 12,
      "text": "But the law does not rest on faith; on the contrary, “Whoever does the works of the law will live by them.”"

      "verse": 13,
      "text": "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”—"

    {
      "verse": 16,
      "text": "Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring; it does not say, “And to offsprings,” as of many, but it says, “And to your offspring,” that is, to one person, who is Christ."
    },
    {
      "verse": 17,
      "text": "My point is this: the law, which came four hundred thirty years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise."
    },
    {
      "verse": 18,
      "text": "For if the inheritance comes from the law, it no longer comes from the promise, but God granted it to Abraham through the promise."
    },
    {
      "verse": 19,
      "text": "Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made, and it was ordained through angels by a mediator."
    },
    {
      "verse": 20,
      "text": "Now a mediator involves more than one party, but God is one."
    },
    {
      "verse": 21,
      "text": "Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could make alive, then righteousness would indeed come through the law."
    },
    {
      "verse": 22,
      "text": "But the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin, so that what was promised through the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
